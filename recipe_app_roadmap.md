# Recipe Recommendation App Roadmap: Pantry-to-Plate

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning

### 1.1 Project Initialization

Let's begin by setting up our development environment for the recipe recommendation app. We'll need to create the project structure and install the necessary dependencies.

- Create a new project directory
- Initialize a git repository
- Set up a virtual environment for Python
- Create a requirements.txt file listing core dependencies (Flask/Django, SQLAlchemy, pandas, scikit-learn)
- Initialize the basic project structure with folders for:
  - Frontend assets
  - Backend logic
  - Database models
  - API endpoints
  - Recommendation engine
  - Testing

Now that we have our basic structure in place, let's create a configuration file to manage environment variables and settings across different environments (development, testing, production).

### 1.2 Database Schema Design

Before diving into code, we need to design our database schema to store recipes, ingredients, user profiles, and pantry inventories.

- Design the following database models:
  - User (id, username, email, password_hash, preferences)
  - Ingredient (id, name, category, common_measurement_unit)
  - Recipe (id, title, description, prep_time, cook_time, servings, instructions, image_url, source_url)
  - RecipeIngredient (recipe_id, ingredient_id, quantity, unit)
  - UserPantry (user_id, ingredient_id, quantity, expiration_date)
  - UserFavorites (user_id, recipe_id)
  - UserHistory (user_id, recipe_id, date_accessed)

Great! With our database schema outlined, we can now focus on creating the data models.

## Phase 2: Backend Development

### 2.1 Database Setup

Let's start implementing our backend by setting up the database models and migrations.

- Set up the database connection configuration
- Create the database models based on our schema
- Implement database migrations to create tables
- Create seed data for ingredients and some sample recipes
- Implement CRUD operations for each model

Now that we have our database ready, let's move on to the API design that will connect our frontend to the backend.

### 2.2 API Endpoint Development

We need to create RESTful API endpoints that will handle all interactions between the frontend and our data.

- Implement User authentication endpoints:
  - Register, login, logout
  - Password reset
  - Profile management
- Create Pantry management endpoints:
  - Add ingredients to pantry
  - Update quantities
  - Remove ingredients
  - List pantry contents
- Develop Recipe endpoints:
  - Get recipe details
  - Search recipes
  - Filter recipes by criteria
  - Save favorite recipes
- Design Recommendation endpoints:
  - Get recipes based on pantry ingredients
  - Suggest recipes with minimal additional ingredients

Excellent! Our API endpoints are taking shape. Now we need to develop the recommendation engine, which is the core feature of our app.

### 2.3 Recommendation Engine

This is where the magic happens! Let's develop a smart recommendation engine that can suggest recipes based on what users already have.

- Implement ingredient matching algorithm:
  - Exact matching for essential ingredients
  - Substitution logic for similar ingredients
  - Scoring system based on % of matching ingredients
- Create recommendation ranking system:
  - Consider user preferences and dietary restrictions
  - Factor in previous recipe history
  - Incorporate recipe popularity and ratings
- Develop "smart shopping" feature:
  - Identify minimal additional ingredients needed
  - Group recommendations by "shopping effort" required

Great work! The recommendation engine is the heart of our application. Now let's implement user authentication and security.

### 2.4 Authentication and Security

Security is critical, especially since we're handling user data. Let's implement proper authentication and authorization.

- Set up JWT-based authentication
- Implement password hashing and security measures
- Create role-based access control
- Configure CORS policies
- Implement API rate limiting

Now that our backend has a solid foundation, let's move on to developing the frontend.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### 3.1 UI/UX Design

Before coding the frontend, let's plan out the user interface and experience.

- Create wireframes for key pages:
  - User registration/login
  - Home dashboard
  - Pantry management
  - Recipe recommendations
  - Recipe detail view
  - Shopping list
- Design responsive layouts for mobile and desktop
- Define color schemes, typography, and UI components

With our designs ready, we can now build the frontend interface.

### 3.2 Frontend Implementation

Time to bring our UI designs to life! Let's implement the frontend using a modern framework.

- Set up the frontend framework (React, Vue, or Angular)
- Create reusable UI components:
  - Navigation bar
  - Ingredient selector
  - Recipe card
  - Filter controls
  - User profile
- Implement main application pages:
  - User onboarding flow
  - Pantry management interface
  - Recipe recommendation view
  - Recipe detail page
  - Shopping list generator
- Add state management for user data and app preferences

Great progress! Let's integrate our frontend with the backend API.

### 3.3 API Integration

Now we need to connect our frontend to the backend services we've created.

- Implement API service layer for all endpoints
- Set up authentication token handling
- Create loading states and error handling
- Implement offline capabilities and data caching
- Add real-time updates for pantry changes

Excellent! Our app is really coming together. Let's enhance the user experience with some advanced features.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 4.1 Image Recognition for Ingredients

Let's add a convenient feature to help users quickly add ingredients to their pantry.

- Research and integrate image recognition API
- Create camera capture interface
