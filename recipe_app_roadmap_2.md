# Recipe Recommendation App Roadmap: "PantryChef"

## Introduction

Welcome to the development roadmap for PantryChef, an app that recommends recipes based on the ingredients users already have in their pantry. This document outlines a step-by-step process for building the application, with clear phases and testing strategies integrated throughout.

The app will allow users to:
- Input and manage their pantry inventory
- Receive recipe recommendations based on available ingredients
- Save favorite recipes
- Filter recipes based on dietary restrictions and preferences

Let's break down the development process into manageable phases.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Environment Configuration

### 1.1 Project Initialization

First, let's set up our development environment with the necessary tools and frameworks.

1. Create a new project directory structure
2. Initialize a Git repository for version control
3. Set up a virtual environment for Python dependencies
4. Create a requirements.txt file for dependency management
5. Configure development, testing, and production environments

### 1.2 Technology Stack Selection

For this app, we'll need to choose appropriate technologies:

1. Backend: Python with Flask or Django (Flask recommended for lighter weight)
2. Database: PostgreSQL for relational data storage
3. Frontend: React.js for the web interface or React Native for mobile
4. API: RESTful architecture for communication between frontend and backend
5. Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication

### 1.3 Testing Environment Setup

Let's establish our testing framework early:

1. Set up pytest for backend testing
2. Configure Jest for frontend testing
3. Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
4. Create testing directories and initial test files

**Testing Verification:**
- Run a basic smoke test to verify the testing environment is properly configured
- Expected outcome: All testing frameworks should initialize without errors
- Check that test reporting is working correctly
- Verify that CI pipeline executes test suite automatically on code push

## Phase 2: Database Design and Implementation

### 2.1 Data Modeling

Now we'll create the data models to support our application's core functionality:

1. User model (id, username, email, password_hash, preferences)
2. Ingredient model (id, name, category, common_measurement_unit)
3. Pantry model (user_id, ingredient_id, quantity, unit, expiry_date)
4. Recipe model (id, name, instructions, prep_time, cook_time, difficulty, image_url)
5. RecipeIngredient model (recipe_id, ingredient_id, quantity, unit, is_optional)
6. UserFavorite model (user_id, recipe_id, date_added)
7. DietaryRestriction model (id, name, description)
8. UserDietaryRestriction model (user_id, restriction_id)

### 2.2 Database Setup

Let's set up our database and integration:

1. Install PostgreSQL and necessary database adapters
2. Create database migration scripts
3. Implement ORM models corresponding to our data design
4. Set up database connection in the application
5. Create indexes for query optimization

### 2.3 Initial Data Population

We need some data to work with:

1. Create scripts to populate ingredient database from a reliable food database API
2. Add sample recipes for testing
3. Add data validation rules for each model

**Testing Verification:**
- Verify database connectivity by executing simple queries
- Test model relationships by creating associated records and retrieving them
- Check constraint enforcement by attempting to insert invalid data
- Verify migration scripts by running them in test environment
- Expected outcome: Database schema should be created correctly with all tables and relationships
- Error handling: Verify constraints block invalid data entry

## Phase 3: Core Backend Implementation

### 3.1 API Structure Setup

Now let's build the API that will power our application:

1. Design RESTful API endpoints and response formats
2. Implement basic routing framework
3. Create handler functions for each endpoint
4. Set up error handling and response standardization
5. Implement request validation middleware

### 3.2 User Authentication System

Security is critical for user data:

1. Implement user registration process
2. Create secure login functionality with password hashing
3. Set up JWT token generation and validation
4. Implement password reset functionality
5. Create email verification system
6. Add session management

### 3.3 Pantry Management

This is a core feature of our app:

1. Create endpoints for adding/removing ingredients to user's pantry
2. Implement quantity and unit conversion logic
3. Add functionality to update existing pantry items
4. Implement bulk pantry item import
5. Create pantry item expiration notifications

**Testing Verification:**
- Test user registration with valid and invalid data
- Verify login functionality works with correct credentials and fails with incorrect ones
- Check JWT token generation and validation by making authenticated requests
- Test pantry CRUD operations with various data combinations
- Expected outcome: Users should be able to register, login, and manage their pantry items
- Error cases: Verify proper error messages for duplicate emails, password mismatches, and invalid tokens

## Phase 4: Recipe Recommendation Engine

### 4.1 Recipe Search and Filtering

The heart of our application is the recipe recommendation system:

1. Implement basic recipe search by ingredients
2. Create filtering by ingredient match percentage
3. Add recipe search by name and category
4. Implement advanced filtering (cook time, difficulty, etc.)
5. Add pagination for search results

### 4.2 Recommendation Algorithm

Now for the intelligent recommendation system:

1. Design the core matching algorithm based on pantry items
2. Implement scoring system for recipe matches
3. Create "missing ingredients" calculation
4. Add weight-based relevance for staple ingredients
5. Incorporate user preferences into recommendation logic
6. Implement dietary restriction filtering

### 4.3 Favorite and History System

Let's enhance the user experience:

1. Create endpoints to save/unsave favorite recipes
2. Implement viewed recipe history
3. Add functionality to rate recipes
4. Create a recommendation improvement system based on user interactions

**Testing Verification:**
- Test recipe search with various ingredient combinations
- Verify filtering works correctly with multiple criteria
- Check recommendation algorithm with different pantry configurations
- Test edge cases like empty pantry, one ingredient, or very full pantry
