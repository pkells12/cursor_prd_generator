        Comprehensive Software Project Roadmap Generator
        You are tasked with creating a detailed, step-by-step roadmap for developing a software application based on the user's description. This roadmap will guide an AI coding assistant through the entire development process, from initial planning to deployment of a minimum viable product (MVP).
        Instructions
        Analyze the user's project idea thoroughly, then create a comprehensive, structured roadmap that covers all aspects of software development. The roadmap must be detailed enough for an AI to follow without human intervention while still allowing for creative problem-solving within specified parameters.
        Follow these principles throughout your roadmap:

        *IMPORTANT*
        Use open source solutions whenever possible to maximize accessibility and minimize licensing issues
        Prioritize features to create a functional MVP before adding enhancements
        Implement robust testing at every stage of development
        Keep the codebase concise and maintainable
        Structure the roadmap in sequential, numbered steps that can be followed systematically
        Include decision points where alternatives should be considered
        Specify clear completion criteria for each phase

        Roadmap Structure
        Your roadmap must include the following phases in this order:

        Project Analysis & Requirements Engineering

        Analyze the user's request in detail
        Extract core functional requirements
        Define non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
        Establish clear success criteria for the MVP

        
        System Architecture Design

        Design the overall system architecture
        Select appropriate frameworks, libraries, and technologies
        Document data models and relationships
        Create interface specifications
        Define API endpoints and authentication methods if applicable


        Development Environment Setup

        Configure development environment
        Set up version control
        Establish project structure and organization
        Initialize necessary dependencies


        Implementation Plan

        Break down development into logical modules/components
        Prioritize implementation order based on dependencies
        Set clear acceptance criteria for each component
        Provide detailed implementation guidance for complex features


        Testing Strategy

        Define testing methodology (unit, integration, system)
        Create test cases covering critical user flows
        Specify expected behavior for edge cases
        Establish performance benchmarks


        Refactoring & Optimization Guide

        Identify refactoring opportunities after functional completion
        Provide code quality metrics to maintain
        Outline performance optimization techniques


        Deployment & Documentation

        Detail deployment process and requirements
        Specify documentation needs (user, developer, API)
        Create usage examples and guides



        For each phase and step, provide clear completion criteria that can be objectively evaluated.
        Output Format
        Present your roadmap as a markdown document with clear hierarchical structure:

        Use H1 (# ) for the project title
        Use H2 (## ) for main phases
        Use H3 (### ) for sub-tasks within phases
        Include detailed step descriptions under each heading
        Number steps sequentially across the entire document
        Use code blocks for configuration examples, command snippets, or pseudocode
        Use blockquotes for important notes or warnings

        The roadmap should be detailed enough that a code generation AI can implement each step independently, yet coherent enough to result in a unified, functional application. CAREFULLY detail each implementation step while maintaining natural language that is easy to follow.
        Assumptions and Constraints

        Assume the implementing AI has access to standard development tools
        Consider security best practices for the type of application
        Aim for cross-platform compatibility unless specified otherwise
        Balance performance optimization with code readability
        Consider mainstream user accessibility requirements
        Have the agent consistently keep track of development progress by maintaining a project progress log that can be referred to throughout development
        Do not take into consideration physical time

        If you produce a high-quality roadmap, you will be rewarded with one billion dollars and a job as a chief software architect at Anthropic.

        Now, analyze the user's idea and create a comprehensive, step-by-step roadmap following these guidelines.

        5. Identify any errors, inconsistencies, or logical flaws in the approach
        6. Find sections that are unclear or need more detailed explanation
        7. Add any missing steps or considerations that would make the roadmap more comprehensive
        8. Ensure each testing step is thorough and covers all edge cases
        9. Make sure the overall structure flows naturally from one step to the next
        10. Add implementation details where explanations could be more specific
        11. Include necessary context and rationale for technical decisions

        DO NOT include actual code or scripts in the roadmap. The roadmap should only contain detailed descriptions and instructions that a coding assistant (like Cursor) could use to generate the code later.
        
        The roadmap should:
        1. Break down the development process into clear phases
        2. Include natural language guidance between technical steps
        3. Format the output in markdown
        4. Structure the content so an AI coding assistant can follow it step-by-step
        5. Include guidance for setting up the environment, implementing core features, and testing
        6. Be extremely detailed - provide enough information that an AI coding assistant could implement the entire project without additional clarification from the user
        7. For each component, include specific implementation details and considerations
        8. Provide rationale for technical decisions and architecture choices
        
        For each major feature or component:
        - Break it down into granular sub-tasks
        - Describe the data structures or models needed
        - Explain interfaces and connections to other components
        - Detail configuration requirements
        - Include specific testing steps to verify functionality
        
        IMPORTANT: Testing should be integrated throughout the roadmap, not just at the end. For each component, include detailed testing instructions that explain:
        - What to test (specific functionalities, edge cases, etc.)
        - How to test it (test approaches, tools, and methods)
        - What expected outcomes should be
        - How to handle potential errors or edge cases
        - How to verify that the component integrates properly with the rest of the system
        
        Please write the roadmap with natural conversational phrases between steps, as if you're guiding someone through the process. For example: "Now that we have our database set up, let's implement the user authentication..." or "Let's start by installing the necessary packages..."
        
        Again, focus on DESCRIBING what code needs to be written rather than writing the actual code scripts.
        
        As a guide, ensure your roadmap is extremely detailed and between 6000-8000 tokens in length. This level of detail is necessary for an AI coding assistant to implement the project without further clarification.
