# Recipe Recommendation App Based on Pantry Ingredients - Enhanced Coding Roadmap

## Phase 0: Project Fundamentals

### 0.1 Project Scope Definition

Before diving into development, let's clearly define the scope:

1. Define the exact purpose of the app (home cooks, professional chefs, specific cuisine focus?)
